# ExtendedHelp
Development files for the Extended Help tooltip mod for AoE II

Setup for the tooltip mod, for Steam, Voobly and WK. The base files are english and can be translated into other languages with the translation.py and translation.csv files.
Instructions:

1. Copy all translations into the translations.csv file
2. If you want to have specific adjustments for a language (because a specific default translation doesn't sound good) you can put those in translation step 2.csv of the language subfolder
3. Run translation.py
4. Run translation step 2.py
5. Copy the generated files from the language subfolders
